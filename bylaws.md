# Austin DSA Bylaws
Approved by membership on December 19, 2020

Approved by the Austin DSA Leadership Committee on November 17, 2020

## Article 1. Name

The name of the organization will be the Austin Democratic Socialists of America, also referred to as Austin DSA, ATXDSA, or the Austin chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).

## Article 2. Purpose

The purpose of Austin DSA will be consistent with that of the national organization of DSA.

We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.

The principles of feminist process for holding decision-making meetings and discussions includes the following principles:

Respect the Facilitator(s). Members should be aware of the facilitator(s) and their responsibility to ensure a comradely and productive meeting.

Identify Goals and Objectives for the Meeting. Friction is more likely where meetings do not have clear purposes and outcomes, so agendas should state what the objectives and goals of a particular meeting are.

“Share the Air.” Members should be aware of how often they are speaking or interjecting, and make an effort to save their comments or questions if they are interrupting or dominating the conversation.

Make “I” Statements. Rather than objective assertions, statements framed as “I think…” and “I feel….” and “In my experience…” should be used in political discussions.

Address Behavior, Not Individuals. If the course of a conversation or discussion has become contentious, address the behavior causing the problem rather than attack the individual(s) involved.

Do Not Be Afraid to Apologize or Ask for an Apology. Comrades should be comfortable asking for resolution through apology, and comrades should freely offer apologies with the understanding that cooperation is built through mutual understanding and trust.

Do Not Assign Motives. Assuming good faith includes not assuming you understand other people’s motives for taking or supporting a particular position.

Mindfulness of Jargon. Everyone should feel comfortable expressing themselves- try to avoid use of jargon or in-group speak.

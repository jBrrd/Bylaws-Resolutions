# Austin DSA Bylaws
Approved by membership on December 19, 2020

Approved by the Austin DSA Leadership Committee on November 17, 2020

## Article 1. Name

The name of the organization will be the Austin Democratic Socialists of America, also referred to as Austin DSA, ATXDSA, or the Austin chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).

## Article 2. Purpose

The purpose of Austin DSA will be consistent with that of the national organization of DSA.

We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.

## ADDENDUM 1. FEMINIST PROCESS

The principles of feminist process for holding decision-making meetings and discussions includes the following principles:

Respect the Facilitator(s). Members should be aware of the facilitator(s) and their responsibility to ensure a comradely and productive meeting.

Identify Goals and Objectives for the Meeting. Friction is more likely where meetings do not have clear purposes and outcomes, so agendas should state what the objectives and goals of a particular meeting are.

“Share the Air.” Members should be aware of how often they are speaking or interjecting, and make an effort to save their comments or questions if they are interrupting or dominating the conversation.

Make “I” Statements. Rather than objective assertions, statements framed as “I think…” and “I feel….” and “In my experience…” should be used in political discussions.

Address Behavior, Not Individuals. If the course of a conversation or discussion has become contentious, address the behavior causing the problem rather than attack the individual(s) involved.

Do Not Be Afraid to Apologize or Ask for an Apology. Comrades should be comfortable asking for resolution through apology, and comrades should freely offer apologies with the understanding that cooperation is built through mutual understanding and trust.

Do Not Assign Motives. Assuming good faith includes not assuming you understand other people’s motives for taking or supporting a particular position.

Mindfulness of Jargon. Everyone should feel comfortable expressing themselves- try to avoid use of jargon or in-group speak.

The HGO(s) responsible for adjudicating the dispute will determine whether the report is credible and, if necessary, make a recommendation to Steering Committee of appropriate disciplinary action as soon as practicable, but ultimately within thirty days of the report being filed. This is to ensure the timely, efficient, accurate, and discreet adjudication of all reports. The HGO(s) may notify Steering of the accuser’s report and its substance at any time after the report is filed, but must give written notice to both the accuser and the accused member before doing so.
    4. HGO responsibilities. The HGO(s) will:
        1. Receive, acknowledge receipt of, and archive accuser reports;
        2. Contact the accused to notify them of the accusations, request their written response, and archive any written response;
        3. Conduct any necessary investigation of the claim; and
        4. Present their findings to the Steering Committee with a written report and, if necessary, a recommendation for disciplinary action.
        5. If necessary, HGO(s) may recommend that parties do not contact each other for the duration of the investigative process.
        6. Compile a yearly report that details:
            1. How many reports were made
            2. How many were taken to the disciplinary process
            3. How many disciplinary actions were taken
            4. Any recommended changes for making the reporting system more effective
            6. This report will not include personally identifying information of any parties in any dispute. The local HGO(s) will send the yearly report to the national HGO(s) no later than January 1 of the new year.
3. Remedies and penalties
    1. Determinations 
        1. All reports will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the HGO(s) and Steering Committee associated with the accuser’s reporting channel.

    2. Standard for Determining if a Report is Credible. 
        1. The chapter’s Steering Committee or, in the case of DSA National, the NPC will find the factual allegation in a report is "credible" if it more-likely-than-not occurred.
    3. Remedies and Penalties.

            4. Removal from DSA; and
            5. Any and all other relief deemed necessary and just by the chapter or national leadership.
        2. If a local chapter has established suspension or expulsion procedures, Steering Committee is authorized to enforce these remedies and penalties in accordance with those procedures.
        3. If the local chapter does not have established suspension or expulsion procedures, they will adopt the procedures outlined in Article III, Section 4 of the DSA Constitution and Article I, Section 3 of DSA bylaws.
            1. The NPC majority required in these procedures will instead by a Steering Committee majority

        5. The appropriate form of relief will be determined by, among other things:
            1. The request of the accuser;
            2. The severity of the offense;
            3. The response of the accused; and
            4. The accused’s relevant behavioral histories.
4. Appeals process. Either party may appeal the form of relief determined by Steering Committee by filling out appellate form created by the accuser’s reporting channel. Appeals must be filed within thirty days of receiving written notice of the Steering Committee’s decision. The limited grounds for appeal are:
    1. Either party believes the behavior was not interpreted using the standards for harassment set out in Section 1a;
    2. Procedural errors, misconduct, or conflicts of interest affected the fairness of the outcome; and
    3. The remedy or penalty determined by Steering was grossly disproportionate to the violation committed
5. Retaliation. This policy prohibits retaliation against any member for bringing a complaint of harassment pursuant to this policy. This policy also prohibits retaliation against a person who assists someone with a complaint of harassment, or participates in any manner in an investigation or resolution of a complaint of discrimination or harassment. Retaliatory behaviors includes threats, intimidation, reprisals, and/or adverse actions related to organizing. If any party to the complaint believes there has been retaliation, they may inform the HGO who will determine whether to factor the retaliation into the original complaint, or treat it as an individual incident.
